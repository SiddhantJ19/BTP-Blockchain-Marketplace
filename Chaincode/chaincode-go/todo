Smart access control using blockchain

usecase -> 2 organizations want to share the iot data
why use blockchain ? The people associated with the data should be able to verify how is their data being used

Architecture


OrgA          -------------------channel---------------------                     OrgB
DEVICE_001
ADMIN


1. ADMIN registers DEVICE_001
2. DEVICE_001 sends data to one of the peers of Org1
3. The channel is the marketplace, where orgs can put the deals and query the deals
4. The data rests in the private data store
5. The organizations communicate about the deal off the blockchain network
6. Now Org1 can update the ACL (part of private data) to allow / deny data share
7. Once the sharing is on, latest data is replicated from device-data-section (pvt data)
    to data-sharing-section (pvt data but with read access to org2 also)
8. The org2 can query from the this section (collection defined in collection-config)
9. The data itself remains for a limited time


Updates possible
1. include some kind of payment and verification info for data share
2. include feature to completly transfer the ownership


Deliverables
1. package network setup as bash scripts
2. all chaincode invocations via apis
2. interface to view blockchain data other than couchDB
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks
1. split pvtdata.sh file in functions, use orijnal network.sh file


Network 
orgs
    - peers
    - admin user

channel



hash of every asset or device data is also stored on channel ledger.
query all assets for sale on marketplace


ctrl + b 
% - vertical pane
" - horizontal pane
, - rename window
c - create a new window within a session
d - detach a session


tmux attach -t <session_name>
tmux rename-session -t 0 git
tmux new -s docker -> create a new session with name docker
