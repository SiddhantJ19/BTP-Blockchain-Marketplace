how to describe data ?
single key update
multiple json as data


asset transfer private data
1. Transfer asset - 
    ORGB sets appraisal value for an asset. The asset is on sale by orgA
    also set transferAgreement{assetID} in asset collection (marketplace)

2. To compare the privatedatahash, the contract needs access to the location of
    ORGB's MSP - No, GetPrivateDataHash(collection_name, key) returns just the hash of the data
    the collection name however has to be known.


    Trade ID as key for trade agreement


PRivate data collections
    1. Marketplace - both orgs
    2. DeviceDeals - both orgs - The price at which the org wants to sell device's service
    2. DevicesPrivateDetails - one org
    3. DevicesDataCollection - one org - incoming data from devices stored in respective DEV_ID keys
    4. ACL - oneORG - KEY = TradeID (asset + other org)
    5. CommonCollection - Data sharing key = timestamp + tradeID


1. ORGA adds a devices in the  - DevicePrivateDetails 
2. Device sends data to ORGA's  - DevicesDataCollection
3. ORGA ADMIN puts the data on marketplace and DeviceDeals 
4. ORGB range queries the marketplace to see datas on sale
5. ORGB ORGA communicates offchain for the deal
6. ORGB updates its DeviceDeals with some price for the data. TradeID
6.5 --> ORGB also puts the agreement on the marketplace, inorder to confirm that they are bidding as buyer {tradeID , buyerID, DeviceDeals Collection name}
7 ORGA range queries with tradeID to see who are all bidders
8.  Smartcontract checks with valid bidders (those whose privatedatahash matches with that of deal) and Creates ACL for them (maybe time based acc to the deal)
9. The device's data is sent to all the ORGS with ACL True for respective Trade IDs
